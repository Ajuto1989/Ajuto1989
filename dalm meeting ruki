Based on the two transcripts, here's a comprehensive summary of how app onboarding will work for both DALM and Notebooks:

## Overall App Onboarding Flow

### **Two Main Phases:**
1. **Governance Phase** - handled by COPTR
2. **Provisioning Phase** - coordinated between DALM and COPTR

## **DALM App Onboarding Process**

### **New Application Creation:**
- User creates application in DALM UI
- User selects GCP project ID and required services
- DALM calls COPTR's RIR (Resource Intake Request) API
- COPTR validates if CIR (Cloud Intake Request) exists for the application

### **Two Scenarios for CIR:**

**Scenario 1: No CIR exists**
- COPTR creates a draft/incomplete CIR
- Returns redirection link to COPTR console
- User fills governance details in COPTR extension
- After CIR approval, provisioning proceeds

**Scenario 2: CIR already exists**
- COPTR identifies existing approved CIR
- Pre-populates approved services
- User selects relevant services for their application
- Proceeds directly to provisioning

### **Profile Onboarding (Environment-specific):**
- User can onboard to different environments: Dev, Research, Test, Prod
- Each environment may have different approval requirements
- COPTR determines approval requirements based on environment
- Service account creation and role assignments happen per environment

## **Notebooks Integration**

### **Current Setup:**
- Notebooks apps will converge into DALM applications
- For **Research environment**: Users stay in Notebooks
- For **Production**: Must use DALM for productionization

### **Integration Flow:**
- Notebooks team will call DALM APIs for production workloads
- Behind the scenes, DALM handles COPTR integration
- No direct COPTR integration needed for Notebooks team

## **Environment-Specific Behavior**

### **Development Environment:**
- **No CIR required** for dev environment
- COPTR can implicitly create resources without approval process
- Simplified onboarding flow

### **Research Environment:**
- Handled primarily through Notebooks
- When productionizing, moves to DALM

### **Production/Pre-Production:**
- **CIR mandatory** with full approval process
- CMO approval, budget approval, architecture review required
- Full governance workflow through COPTR

## **Key Technical Components**

### **APIs and Integration:**
- **RIR API**: Main integration point between DALM and COPTR
- **CIR validation**: COPTR checks approval status
- **Service Account Creation**: COPTR handles via dedicated endpoints
- **CMS Integration**: Moving from P2C config to CMS for metadata storage

### **Response Flow:**
- COPTR returns RIR ID for tracking
- DALM shows provisioning status on overview page
- Asynchronous processing through batch jobs
- PubSub notifications for status updates (future enhancement)

## **User Experience:**

### **Seamless Integration:**
- User starts in DALM but gets redirected to COPTR for governance
- Appears as single application experience
- Context preservation between applications via URL parameters

### **Pre-population:**
- COPTR pre-fills known information from existing CIRs
- Reduces duplicate data entry
- Maintains consistency across systems

## **Deployment Architecture:**
- COPTR services in HRZ zone
- Cross-zone communication via dispatcher services
- Different deployment strategies for different environments (Dev, Sandbox, Production)

This architecture ensures proper governance while providing a streamlined user experience, with environment-specific rules handled transparently by the backend systems.
